Project Background:

To solve the Looking Globe-ally Challenge, we decided to build a game to increase awareness of climate change. To do this, global CO2 and temperature data from NASA was utilized.



Project Description:

The object of the game is to pollute the entire planet by building factories, energy plants, and farms. The initial parameters of the simulation are based of off 1958 levels, and the game ends at 2018, at which point the simulation data should be compared with the actual data from the last 70 years.



Challenges:

This game was built entirely in Unity, which presented a challenge to all of us, as no one had any prior coding experience in Unity.



Future Steps:

The next steps would be to take to make the game more educational and entertaining. To do this, we would need to further integrate NASA data, balance the game-play, and model environmental factors more realistically. Other minor changes would be to update the UI and graphics.
